# Features
1. Allow system administrators to easily deploy variety of Linux machines through a click/select interfaces (free distriutions)
 - arch, fedora, Ubuntu, centos
2. Allow system administrators to customize the install of the systems by allowing them to choose the packages they want ( apache, nginx, openssh server)
3. Provide stats for the deployed machines
 - uptime, cpu/gpu performance, network, temperature graphs.
 - Notify on crash/high traffic via email
 - Health monitoring
 - Allow system administrators to save their OS images as templates and share them on the website
- Allow importing and exporting of SSH public keys. Possible multiple auths
- Allow web console to manage the system

# Possible Reading materials
1. Architecting the Cloud: Design Decisions for Cloud Computing Service Models (SaaS, PaaS, and IaaS) `Michael J. Kavis`
 -  An expert guide to selecting the right cloud service model for your business, allowing for the delivery of computing and storage capacity to a diverse community of end-recipients. Helping you cut through all the haze, Architecting the Cloud is vendor neutral and guides you in making one of the most critical technology decisions that you will face: selecting the right cloud service model(s) based on a combination of both business and technology requirements.

2. Cloud Computing: Concepts, Technology & Architecture (The Prentice Hall Service Technology Series from Thomas Erl) `Thomas Erl`
 - Is for beginners looking to learn more about cloud computing and gives a broad over view of the topic. Erl teams up with cloud computing experts and researchers to break down cloud computing technologies and practices. The book also establishes business-centric models and metrics that allow for the financial assessment of cloud-based IT resources and their comparison to those hosted on traditional IT enterprise premises. It also provides templates and formulas for calculating SLA-related quality-of-service values and numerous explorations of the SaaS, PaaS and IaaS.

3. Cloud Computing Explained: Implementation Handbook for EnterprisesCloud Computing ExplainedCloud Computing Explained `John Rhoton`
 - describes the benefits and challenges of Cloud Computing and leads the reader through the process of assessing the suitability of a cloud-based approach for a given situation, calculating and justifying the investment that is required to transform the process or application, and then developing a solid design that considers the implementation as well as the ongoing operations and governance required to maintain the solution in a partially outsourced delivery model.
