 - three elements: citation of source, summary of the source and relevance

eg Paper: (Flanagan, Stevens, Pocock, Lee, & Wipat, 2004), “Ontology for genome comaparison and genomic rearrangements.”
Description: This paper briefly looks at the limitations of current comparative sequence analysis tools, and outlines an ontology for describing genomic rearrangements, as well as their biological and evolutionary function.
Relevance: This paper nicely frames the motivation for my project as it outlines the need for automation when it comes to the annotation of biologically meaningful data in comparison sequence data.

include about 6 sources

4. Diagrammatic work plan
 - Gantt chart about project execution ( when what will be done)
 - weekly to byweekly plan


 5. References
