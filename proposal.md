# Web Platform for Digital Deployment of Virtual Servers

# Motivation and rationale
## Context
In 2016 there are currently three billion people that have access to the internet. The website google.com handles between two and three billion search queries per day. Achieving such task requires full utilisation of the available hardware [[1]](#1). Part of the reason for Google's scalability and performance is the emergence of cloud infrastructure.  The topic of my dissertation is tightly connected with one of the building blocks of cloud computing, which is virtualisation.
Creating a platform for virtual machines enables an organisation to quickly set up any environment that might be required for everyday operations. This yields the following benefits. One server rack with many cores and enough RAM can easily service an entire office department.

## Problem
Contrast that with the expensive alternative of purchasing expensive computer per person which requires physical access to perform repairs and maintenance. Physical systems are also more difficult to manage due to their distributions. Another downside is hardware utilisation, a case where one machine uses maximum resources but another one is idle. The solution of this problem is virtualisation. With this technology, which is part of modern Intel processor chips, one server can run numerous operating systems concurrently. This helps with utilisation and performance, as a virtual machine can be configured on the fly to use more or less resources. Another problem that my work will help to solve is .....

The final product will allow a system manager to open a website, fill in a web form with information about the desired virtual machine, click a button and create an operating system. The user should also be able to get credentials for that machine, as well as select for installation software from common packages.
