Intel has realized significant benefits from deploying
its own private cloud, from increased agility—server
provisioning dropped from 90 days to 45 minutes—and
reduced operational costs—$21 million in savings since
2009.

Here’s the difference: Virtualization abstracts compute
resources—typically as virtual machines (VMs)—with
associated storage and networking connectivity. The
cloud determines how those virtualized resources are
allocated, delivered, and presented. Virtualization is not
necessary to create a cloud environment, but it enables
rapid scaling of resources in a way that nonvirtualized
environments find hard to achieve. (intel

  Results from a Gartner survey of 505 data center managers
worldwide reports that planned or in-process virtualization of
infrastructure workloads will increase from approximately 60 percent
in 2012 to almost 90 percent in 2014.4)

Infrastructure as a service is built on pooled resources for computing, storage, and networking. (From An Enterprise Private Cloud Architecture and

provided private virtual LANs (PVLANs) and separated rolebased
administration for each host. < on security
