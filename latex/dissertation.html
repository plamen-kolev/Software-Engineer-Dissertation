<!--l. 285--><p class="noindent" >As of the year 2016, there are currently three billion people that have access
to the internet [<a 
href="#Xictonline">15</a>]. Google handles between two and three billion search
queries per day [<a 
href="#Xa">30</a>]. Dealing with so many requests on daily basis requires full
utilisation of the available hardware resources. Part of Google&#8217;s ability to scale
and be efficient is due to the emergence of cloud infrastructure. The topic
of this paper deals with one of the building blocks of cloud computing -
virtualisation.

<!--l. 291--><p class="indent" >   The term virtualisation is defined as the ability of one piece of hardware to run
multiple operating systems [<a 
href="#Xb">17</a>]. In this paper, a virtual machine, or an instance, is an
operating system that runs on top of a &#8221;physical&#8221; operating system. The &#8221;physical&#8221;
<a 
href="#glo:operating-system"><span id="textcolor4">operating system</span></a> is referred to as the &#8221;host&#8221; system. Creating a platform
that uses such technology enables an organisation to quickly set up any
environment (operating system) that can be used in a variety of cases. It is
important to note that there are two forms of virtualisation, bare-metal and
hosted [<a 
href="#Xvirtualisation-security-guidance">10</a>]. This work uses the latter approach. The difference is illustrated in
<a

<!--l. 302--><p class="indent" >   When a business wants to buy a high performing computer for each employee,
that would requires physical access to perform repairs, maintenance and
management. Physical systems are more difficult to manage because they are
distributed across a large area, making quick access slow or impossible. Another
downside of not using virtualisation is non-scalable hardware utilisation. This is the
case where one machine uses maximum resources but another one is idle.
A computer that has predefined hardware specification cannot use more
processing power than initially installed. Automating physical servers is also
nearly impossible due to them lacking the necessary abstraction control
layer.
<!--l. 305--><p class="indent" >   These are some problems that virtualisation technology can solve. It is now a core
part of most new desktop Intel chips and is integral part of all server-grade
processors as listed in the manufacturer&#8217;s page [<a 
href="#Xintel-virtualisation-chip-support">31</a>].
<!--l. 307--><p class="indent" >   This helps with performance, as a virtual machine can be configured on the fly to
use flexible amount of resources or a shared pool of computational units. This
technology also allows for easy server migration. A physical machine cannot be
moved in a couple of minutes to a different continent (physical location) but a
virtualised operating system can be &#8221;copy-pasted&#8221; at will for very little cost. Physical
infrastructure is also prone to hardware-related bugs. This is a case when a software
solution causes issues, because it was not tested on all the machines that run it.
These physical machines might have different network cards, processors, lack certain
hardware components or have older hardware version. The virtual platform has the
benefit of abstracting away these components, ensuring that once tested,
the software running on top of it would exhibit predictable behaviour [<span

<!--l. 309--><p class="indent" >   How does virtualisation allow for easy <a 
href="#glo:migration"><span id="textcolor5">migrations</span></a>? It achieves the task by
abstracting away the available physical storage medium. On the virtualised host, they

<!--l. 323--><p class="noindent" >The project aims to utilise open-source virtualisation technology and make the
process of managing and creating virtual machines automated through a web
interface. The solution should allow a system manager to open a website, fill in a web
form with enough information about the desired <a 
href="#glo:operating-system"><span id="textcolor7">operating system</span></a>, click a button and
create it. After that, the person should be able to securely download identity file and
connect to the machine.
<!--l. 325--><p class="indent" >   The management website should also allow for the selection of predefined software
packages. The solution should also show if the virtual machine is alive and allow the
user to shut it down and bring it up. Port management should also be possible when
building the machine. These features, alongside the benefits of virtualisation should
create a secure infrastructure for many applications, from virtual office workstation,
to server testing and deployment.

<!--l. 328--><p class="noindent" >This solution is aimed at small companies who want to get the benefits of
virtualisation, as well as easier machine management. It does so by giving the user
common Linux versions, simple credential management and instructions during
operations. The target demographic is also businesses who have low budget for
automation and system management and cannot afford to have a dedicated team
member for the task. Another use case is individuals who want to perform
calculations on a machine and then power it off, who do not have resources or the
time to set up their own environment.

Computing: The way forward considers an architecture that interleaves different
hardware components together, enabling their utilisation on-demand. For example, a
cluster of graphic cards or processors that support different <a

architectures (x86, ARM, ATOM) can be attached in domain-specific tasks. Such
set-up would allow the platform to be more flexible and less congested because
these dedicated components would do the &#8221;heavy lifting. It also has the
benefit of doing special computations - like rendering video much quicker and
efficient.

<!--l. 370--><p class="indent" >   &#8221;Virtualization abstracts compute resourcestypically as virtual machines
(VMs)with associated storage and networking connectivity. The cloud determines
how those virtualized resources are allocated, delivered, and presented. Virtualization
is not necessary to create a cloud environment, but it enables rapid scaling of
resources in a way that nonvirtualized environments find hard to achieve.&#8221;[<a 
href="#Xintel-cloud-computing-guide">4</a>][p10]
<!--l. 379--><p class="indent" >   Virtualisation provides the abstraction that makes it much easier to get data to
and from the cloud. This technology is the basis for creating high availability services
and applications when implemented properly.[<a 
href="#Xintel-cloud-computing-guide">4</a>][p10]. Intel&#8217;s virtualisation and cloud
computing guide talks about it as a way to provide corporate platform services in a
more organised matter. The guide also covers making the infrastructure easier to
organise from the standpoint of <a 
href="#glo:IT"><span id="textcolor12">I.T.</span></a>. This is the case because these virtual
servers are easier to diagnose and monitor as well as organise and automate
[<a 
href="#Xintel-cloud-computing-guide">4</a>][p8]. Virtual machine diagnostics and monitoring is a practice where the
behaviour of the machine is observed over a period of time. This includes
network traffic, memory usage, <a 
href="#glo:cpu"><span id="textcolor13">CPU</span></a> performance and utilisation. It also
contains information about how much disk storage the machine is taking and
information about the machine&#8217;s running status. Additionally, x86 computer
architecture support hardware statistics counters. Performance counters
are part of the kernel&#8217;s sub-system and are the basis for providing reliable
hardware information for monitoring and reporting [<a 
href="#Xrhel-performance-counters">25</a>]. This data can be
used to gain insights into why a machine is malfunctioning. These counters
can be vital in determining the type of issue with the machine (network
related issue, hard-drive read-write failure, defecting processor, etc.). Network
outages can be detected and accommodated for by analysing aggregated
network statistics. This is useful in an event of denial of service attacks
(DoS). High networking usage might indicate malicious behaviour such as
artificial congestion - an attacker making numerious requests to slow down the
service. On the other hand, this type of monitoring can ensure on-demand
scaling in critical moments. Legitimate customer demands must be met by
allocating more hardware and network bandwidth as a result of increased
demand.
<!--l. 385--><p class="indent" >   Virtual machine organisation is the practice of managing a variety of components
associated with the platform and its resources. The <a 
href="#glo:IT"><span id="textcolor14">I.T.</span></a> department of an
organisation is in charge of managing the physical storage on which the
&#8221;virtual&#8221; platform is running. In the infrastructure disks are partitioned and
organised in pools - then mounted over the network. This configuration
uses S.A.N, or storage area network. This is a network entirely dedicated to
transferring data between computer systems and the storage drives [<a 
href="#Xibm-san-storage">32</a>][p.11].
Mapping physical drives to virtual ones over the network is a stepping stone in
enabling any type of server infrastructure, including virtualised one, to have
enough capacity to grow and meet the customer&#8217;s demands. It also ensures the
right level of redundancy, as a large portion of the hard drives can be put in
place in case of a failure. Storing virtual machine on network drives makes it
possible to copy machine instance from one cluster to another, or change data
centres.
                                                                  <img

<!--l. 388--><p class="indent" >   Any server infrastructure requires high bandwidth network connection, virtual
networks are no exception. The network throughput of the platform depends on the
internet service provider (ISP) physical connection speed. That network is used
by the virtualisation platform and is converted to numerous private and
public networks internally. The benefits of such abstraction is the ability to
create flexible and disposable internal/external networks per machine or
cluster of machines. The ability to share a network, or be in a private network
is a security consideration. This feature is important from the standpoint
of security. For example, for a business logic application, one can set up
a client-facing web server that is accessible from the global internet. The
machine on which this application is running will have a database connection to
another machine running a dedicated database software (mysql, postgresql,
mongodb,etc.). The connection between the two machine would be configured
as a private network. It ensures that nobody from the outside world has
access to that database machine. This configuration is explored in Amazon&#8217;s
accessing database instance in a virtual cloud[<a 
href="#Xamazon-scenarios-for-accessing-db-instance-in-vpc">29</a>]. The setup is shown in figure
<span

<!--l. 391--><p class="indent" >   It is impossible to talk about such infrastructure without considering the most
important component of operations, the <a

computation at time critical periods can take advantage of more computation. An
example would be personal project of Harrison Kinsley for gene sequencing in his

<!--l. 473--><p class="indent" >   A hypervisor is a computer software or hardware that creates the platform layer
to a virtual machine and makes it possible to host multiple instances with different
configurations [<a

<!--l. 475--><p class="indent" >   Initially, the plan was to use a hypervisor virtualisation solution such as
<a 
href="#glo:virtualbox"><span id="textcolor38">virtualbox</span></a> and <a 
href="#glo:vmware"><span id="textcolor39">VmWare</span></a> just by themselves, and use the <a 
href="#glo:bash"><span id="textcolor40">bash</span></a> shell scripting language
to interface directly with them. A decision was made to use Virtualbox, as it is an
<a 
href="#glo:open-source"><span id="textcolor41">open-source</span></a> software solution, has strong community, allows third party
plug-ins and is a solution build by Oracle - a large software corporation.
There are other alternatives (gnome boxes, CHROOT), but what influenced
the choice is that virtualbox is configurable and can be controlled from the
command-line straight out of the box. Another deciding factor was also
the extensibility that it offers with third party modules developed by the
community and the core team (guest additions, virtualbox standard development
kit).
<!--l. 477--><p class="indent" >   Another reason for not choosing a more unpopular technology is due to the
willingness of an adopter to switch their entire virtual infrastructure to it. The
Virtualbox software is well supported by Oracle, and as such, it would make the
transition to the platform easier.
<!--l. 479--><p class="indent" >   During the period when researching Virtualbox, the command-line <a 
href="#glo:api"><span id="textcolor42">API</span></a>
documentation was used extensively. In the process, a variety of customisable
parameters when building a virtual machine were discovered, like the different
possibilities in setting up networks (private, network shared, host only, etc.), exposing
ports, as well as different hardware configurations (RAM, hard drive, CPU count).
After using the command line tools and writing a simple shell scripts for managing
creation of different resources, a decision was made to use a tool that manages the
different technical details of each virtual machine. Instead of building the manager
from scratch, an open-source hypervisor provisioner software was used instead. The
tools is called <a

<!--l. 502--><p class="noindent" >The framework that was created uses a <a 
href="#glo:virtual_machine"><span id="textcolor46">virtual machine</span></a> instance object and
authenticated user that owns it. When the user fills the web form with the relevant
information, it will pass the configuration values directly to a virtual machine
class. This class contains a dynamic configuration, which ensures that the
solution is distribution agnostic. Here, the term distribution references to the
different versions of Linux (Ubuntu, fedora, Centos, arch Linux). Separating
dependency specific configuration by sub-classing a configuration object allows
for a quick way for the project to be extended to accommodate for new
distributions.
<!--l. 504--><p class="indent" >   To do so, folder with the name of the new distribution must be placed in
lib/configurations that describes the configuration specific settings that include
updating and installing common software packages.
<!--l. 506--><p class="indent" >   The framework also uses UNIX environmental variable to manage infrastructure
state. For the purpose of continuous integration, two main isolated environments are
used - testing and development/production. The most notable usage of such
environment is the virtual host-only network that ensures that network interfaces do
not clash during testing and development. The two interfaces are <span 
class="cmtt-10">vboxnet0 </span>and
<span 
class="cmtt-10">vboxnet1</span>. One is for general purpose development, the another is for testing. A
special host-only adapter is used to have an isolated ip range that is network
agnostic, for example, on a <a 
href="#glo:natnetwork"><span id="textcolor47">NAT network</span></a>, some IP addresses might be reserved
or used, this case will cause a clash and the virtual machine will not be
reachable.
<!--l. 509--><p class="indent" >   Continuous integration is a new software development practice where versions of
the product are merged and available after testing/building phase. It also enables
features to be developed separately from the production environment. This
has the benefit of ensuring production code performs as expected without
interruptions.

<!--l. 512--><p class="noindent" >When considering the architecture of the system, a list of factors were evaluated
when building the solution. One is having few well consolidated moving parts,
ensuring flexibility and extensibility. For that purpose the programming language
<a 
href="#glo:ruby"><span id="textcolor48">ruby</span></a> was chosen. It is a suitable for system automation as it is very expressive and is
for the most part platform independent (interpreted). Its suitability comes also from
the available tools <a 
href="#glo:vagrant"><span id="textcolor49">Vagrant</span></a> and <a 
href="#glo:puppet"><span id="textcolor50">puppet</span></a> which allow end-to end integration when
developing and testing. The <a 
href="#glo:ruby"><span id="textcolor51">ruby</span></a> programming language also draws inspiration from
the Perl programming language. One of the Perl&#8217;s strengths is its ability to be a more
powerful shell scripting language as well as a general purpose language.
This is the case as it has quick syntax for executing shell scripts directly
and get STDOUT, STDERR and exit-codes quickly. It does also has native
implementation of common UNIX tools, like grep, wget and awk (core GNU
utilities).[<a 
href="#Xperl-programming-language-shell-scripting">2</a>]
<!--l. 514--><p class="indent" >   Because the Ruby language draws inspiration and shares similar features with
Perl, it makes it a great modern and powerful language to use in this domain-specific

great quality.

class="cmtt-10">VM.build()</span>. The design
decision to have a separate functionality of bootstrapping instances was mainly for
cleaner testing by compartmentalising the components into smaller elements. The
<span 
class="cmtt-10">build </span>method also accepts a boolean argument. This argument tells the current
build if it is in &#8221;dry-run&#8221; mode. The mode, the machine will create directories and
configuration without actually bringing the instance up and running. This is again,
done for testing reasons - they verify that different <a 
href="#glo:distribution"><span id="textcolor62">distributions</span></a> have appropriate
configurations.
<!--l. 549--><p class="indent" >   During the invocation of the <span 
class="cmtt-10">build </span>method, a <a 
href="#glo:bash"><span id="textcolor63">bash</span></a> shell is forked and it executes
the <a 
href="#glo:vagrant"><span id="textcolor64">Vagrant</span></a> command that brings it on-line and installs all dependencies. The shell
command also tells the script to write all output to a text file in the machine
directory, the file is called <span 
class="cmtt-10">vagrant.log</span>. Because the process takes a long time to
finish, an axillary function <span 
class="cmtt-10">_wait</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_on</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_build </span>is used. This function constantly goes
through the contents of the log file and checks what is the current building state of
the instance. Typical states are building the base, installing puppet, setting up
dependencies, installing packages and the state everything has finished. Upon a
successful build, the sub-shell executable will create a file called <span 
class="cmtt-10">build.log</span>. The file
will contain a build status. Reason for doing so is that otherwise successful run is
determined by exit-code of vagrant, which is not a reliable method of determining
success.
<!--l. 552--><p class="indent" >   The module also partitions the file structure in two parts - <span 
class="cmtt-10">userspace </span>and
<span 
class="cmtt-10">test</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_userspace</span>. The concept of userspace is used to contain virtual machine
configurations in a hierarchical structure. Inside, there is a folder representing each
user registered through the web interface. Inside the user folder, virtual
machine folders with their respective names can be found. Each virtual machine
folder contains <span 
class="cmtt-10">Vagrantfile </span>- file that describes network configuration,
machine type, available hardware resources, etc. The folder also contains
<span 
class="cmtt-10">vagrant.log</span>. This contains detailed information of what happened during the
machine build process, and is the file that a user can view through the web
interface.
<!--l. 554--><p class="indent" >   In <span 
class="cmtt-10">manifests</span>, two very important files can be found. One is in charge of
automating firewall rules, packages, users and permissions. This automation is
done once the machine has been brought to live. The file is created by the
configuration manager depending on which Linux distribution has been used. This
folder also contain a shell script that can be used when automation script is
lacking. This file has been left there for integrity. As mentioned, there is also a
top-level folder called <span 
class="cmtt-10">test</span><span 
class="cmtt-10">_userspace</span>, it is used for separation of concerns
and is where testing machines are deployed to keep production machines
intact.

generates unique pair per instance, and eliminates the risk of forgetting the
password or having someone steal or guess it. Two strategies were considered -
allowing users to import mandatory public key they initially generated, or
generate key that the user can later download. The second approach was
selected, as it would make it much more convenient and intuitive for the target
demographic of the platform. Future work should allow paranoid system
administrators to generate their own keys and disable any keys generated by the
system.

<!--l. 746--><p class="noindent" >Deploying a machine successful is not always the case. Large chunk of the code
ensures that errors are detected, reported and deployment is rolled back (cleanup).
This is important, as the user of the system must always be aware of any
progress or failure. Detecting and reporting unsuccessful builds is done via
providing failure status in the web interface. The failed machine&#8217;s logs are
also accessible, making it possible to report issues via emailing such files
to a system maintainer. The platform detects network failures, <a 
href="#glo:ipaddress"><span id="textcolor80">IP address</span></a>
allocation errors, bad arguments or build taking too much time as well as
deployment script crashes. An issue with this process as of now is that detection
happens, but detailed report of what went wrong is lacking. An extension to the
system should allow the user to go to a dedicated error page. It will give a
description of what exactly caused the failure and give the ability to report
it.

<!--l. 751--><p class="noindent" >Part of allowing users to use any machine they want is due to the platform being
extensible. As described in the work section of this paper, the solution achieves this
extensibility - evident by the supported multiple machines. The issue with this
feature as of now is lack of documentation. An article that describes the process of
adding a new supported distribution with pictures and examples would improve
adoption and ease of use for future development.

current implementation is prone to scalability issues, where numerous instances
linearly slow down the process. The check also has a large overhead due to making
requests to every possible machine (even ones that are known to be in good

As part of the security concerns, this provides secure authentication channel. Future

web interface, as well as revoke old certificate keys. The decision to give
preconfigured authentication credentials is because of the target demographic.

The solution provides the ability to open network ports to the outside world and to
do package management during the install process via the web interface. Currently,
few common packages can be installed to illustrate the functionality. Future work
should go into finding the most vital packages and offer them as an option. This is
possible due to the ability of the solution to extend packages, ports and deployment
flow.
<!--l. 819--><p class="indent" >   Something that is currently lacking is the ability to amend ports and packages.
After the build process is over, one can manually connect to the machine and

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">9.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-480009.1"></a>Constrains</h4>
<!--l. 829--><p class="noindent" >Because of the limited duration of the dissertation and the immense work that has to
be carried throughout the implementation (testing, documentation, development,
debugging, planning, architecture, external tools, hardware constrains, etc.) certain
limitations had to be put in place to ensure that the project will be completed within
the appropriate period.
<!--l. 831--><p class="indent" >   The initial constrain that has been defined is limiting the solution to a single
host. This work is done as a proof-of-concept system that has the potential of
being scaled up and extended to support a cluster deployment in the near
future. Creating a distributed and scalable implementation of this work goes
beyond the scope. This is not to say that it is limited to single host, but
testing and planning guarantee that it will be fully functional under such
condition.
<!--l. 834--><p class="indent" >   As a future task, it would be possible to deploy multiple instances of the
underlying infrastructure that are managed and synchronised with a technology like
puppet or chef. Then, creating virtual machines can be done via a manager machine
that picks a host based on a round-robin algorithm or on load. Additional
implementation steps must be carried out to ensure that the web platform
and the manager understands the physical location of the virtual machine.
Physical location references to the real hardware (the host) running the virtual
machine.
<!--l. 836--><p class="indent" >   Another assumption and a constrain is the availability of a network interface. To
simplify the development process and allow for different isolated environments,
virtual networks were used. A network environment is the space in which all the
virtual machines have visibility of one another. It also makes it possible to allocate
different network addresses dynamically and verify availability of resources. Another
important bit is the fact that one must be connected to the network environment to
communicate with the machines inside of it. VirtualBox&#8217;s host-only networking
interfaces have been used to create multiple network instances that allow for the
creation of machines that are independent of each other when developing and
testing.
<!--l. 838--><p class="indent" >   When further extending the solution, additional work has to be carried out to
ensure integration with a public <a 
href="#glo:dns"><span id="textcolor89">DNS</span></a> server, and some adjustments ought to be made
to allow the production <a 
href="#glo:dns"><span id="textcolor90">DNS</span></a> to allocate <a 
href="#glo:dhcp"><span id="textcolor91">DHCP</span></a> <a 
href="#glo:ipaddress"><span id="textcolor92">IP address</span></a> to the virtual
machines.
<!--l. 840--><p class="indent" >   The solution aims to orchestrate and automate generic virtual machine
deployment, but creating a solution that enables every <a 
href="#glo:operating-system"><span id="textcolor93">operating system</span></a> to be
deployable would require extensive amount of extra work. Future work can make it
possible to deploy Windows, Mac OS and more Linux variants as part of the
infrastructure, but this is yet not the case.
                                                                  <img

<!--l. 842--><p class="indent" >   Windows is not supported yet, as it has completely different architecture and has
a separate interface for managing networking, users, installation and permissions.
Doing windows deployment also requires licensing of their <a 
href="#glo:operating-system"><span id="textcolor94">operating system</span></a>. Another
constrain in working with windows is that not many core components are
configurable or accessible via a script making automation very difficult or impossible,
or are not freely available.
<!--l. 844--><p class="indent" >   Mac OSX virtual deployment was also something left for future. It also has
similar issues to windows virtualisation (licensing, exposed <a 
href="#glo:api"><span id="textcolor95">API</span></a>), as well as it is a
platform that I have no experience with.
<!--l. 846--><p class="indent" >   For the purpose of this work, the decision to have limited scope of allowed Linux
distributions to Ubuntu, Centos and Debian was made, but it is important to note
that the architecture allows extending that list. Development was done with that in
mind.
<!--l. 848--><p class="indent" >   What enables this flexibility is the configuration set-up in <span 
class="cmtt-10">deeploy </span>module. If one
is to add a custom linux distribution, it&#8217;s image must be created from a virtual
machine provider (virtualbox). Doing so consists of creating a base virtual machine,
supply necessary vagrant components to it. Then the machine is exported to an
image, this image is then imported as a vagrant machine. The following
process is explained more in-depth in the official <a 
href="#glo:vagrant"><span id="textcolor96">Vagrant</span></a> documentation

<!--l. 868--><p class="noindent" >As part of the development cycle, I had a supervisor meeting every fortnight. The
goal was to discuss work progress and ensure things are moving forward. During
these meetings, I received feedback, raised concerns and showed progress in a
<a 
href="#glo:standup"><span id="textcolor97">stand-up</span></a> fashion. Occasionally, the meetings were not about progress update, but
about demonstration of the work done so far with the purpose of obtaining feedback
and presentation practice.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-5500013.1"></a>First Semester</h4>
<!--l. 871--><p class="noindent" >When creating the project plan, two core stages were taken into consideration. The
first stage is semester one. During that period, the ground work was laid, on
which all future development and testing was based. This was a critical
moment into the building process. It allowed for a more in-depth research using
materials created by the leading experts in the field (Amazon, Intel, Oracle).
Their guides and documents helped gaining more understanding in various
aspects of building cloud-ready applications, infrastructure security and
automation.
<!--l. 873--><p class="indent" >   The research helped when rationing about the features that need implementing. It
also illustrated the scope, and the challenges that need to be faced. The research gave
an insight into why this problem requires solving, and pointed me to open-source
projects that achieve parts of the work.
<!--l. 875--><p class="indent" >   The first semester was not only about research, but also about describing the
constrains, limitations and infrastructure decisions that need to be made in order to
demonstrate a product that has real-world applications. The materials helped
me also to identify potential risks and issues that might arise, such as the
security risk of running multiple virtual machines onto the same physical
space. This is a potential risk situation, as an attacker can read the private
data of another machine if the person gets access to the memory of the
&#8221;host&#8221;.
<!--l. 878--><p class="indent" >   Work also went into creating presentation and project proposal for the upcoming
work, which gave an outline and highlighted the features that the work addresses.
                                                                  <img

When creating the presentation, I wanted to be as generic as possible as not to
present information and ideas that the additional research might prove impossible to
implement or not practical.

   <h4 class="subsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-5600013.2"></a>Second Semester</h4>
<!--l. 883--><p class="noindent" >The tasks accomplished during the second semester are related to implementing,
refining, iterating, evaluating and documenting the solution. This is the time where
all the main features, functional and non-functional requirements got developed,
tested and documented. It must be noted that for the most part, each cycle was not
incrementally tackled, but instead, numerous development-testing-documenting
phases were used to achieve the final result.

<!--l. 885--><p class="noindent" ><img

<!--l. 888--><p class="indent" >   For the most part, the project was completed using agile principles. Each cycle
that shaped the final product is described below.
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13.2.1   </span> <a 
 id="x1-5700013.2.1"></a>Developmen</h5>
<!--l. 890--><p class="noindent" >As planned, the work was broke down to subtasks. The initial plan is not
to develop the whole system and assemble the parts together at the end,
but to build a minimum viable product (MVP) and increment and improve
onwards.
<!--l. 892--><p class="indent" >   This was done in order to assure that the platform can be built with
the available tools and that the requirements can be met at the end of the
project.
<!--l. 894--><p class="indent" >   Being able to create a virtual machine with a known <a 
href="#glo:ipaddress"><span id="textcolor98">IP address</span></a> from a script was
the first thing that had to be accomplished. Creating custom users, opening ports
and creating the web interface was planned later as something that could be built on
top of the &#8221;core&#8221; product.
<!--l. 896--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13.2.2   </span> <a 
 id="x1-5800013.2.2"></a>Learning period</h5>
<!--l. 897--><p class="noindent" >For the duration of this project, a variety of new technologies were tried and
evaluated, such as <a 
href="#glo:vagrant"><span id="textcolor99">Vagrant</span></a>, <a 
href="#glo:puppet"><span id="textcolor100">puppet</span></a>, <a 
href="#glo:ruby-on-rails"><span id="textcolor101">Ruby On Rails</span></a>, <a 
href="#glo:ruby"><span id="textcolor102">ruby</span></a>.
<!--l. 899--><p class="indent" >   As part of the learning cycle, the official ruby programming language manual was
used. It helped gain proficiency and to understand the fundamental constructs that
were used throughout the tutorials, articles, blogs and other learning materials. The
process taught me about declaring variables, scopes, for loops and any extra syntax
unlike other programming languages. To get up and running with <a 
href="#glo:ruby"><span id="textcolor103">ruby</span></a>, the period
                                                                  <img 
src="dissertation157x.png" alt="PICT" >
<img 
src="dissertation158x.png" alt="PICT" >
                                                                  
between first and second semester was planned to build basic command line
programs.
<!--l. 901--><p class="indent" >   Another part of the development strategy was to do a small web project using
ruby on rails just to get a feeling of what is possible in terms of rapid development
and ease of use. This small project included building forms, validation, manipulating
database objects and creating <a 
href="#glo:html"><span id="textcolor104">html</span></a> pages. This was done in February (the beginning
of second semester), with the purpose of determining if this tool is right for the
job.
<!--l. 903--><p class="indent" >   The task of learning <a 
href="#glo:puppet"><span id="textcolor105">puppet</span></a> was achieved by creating end-to-end automation
scrip of an apache server doing various tasks. Puppet&#8217;s power is to get a
machine&#8217;s configuration to a known state and ensure all software packages
are present. Doing this exercise was overall a good practice, as it led to a
faster implementation and integration later on when working on the actual
platform.
<!--l. 905--><p class="noindent" >
   <h5 class="subsubsectionHead"><span class="titlemark">13.2.3   </span> <a 
 id="x1-5900013.2.3"></a>Documentation</h5>
<!--l. 906--><p class="noindent" >The initial plan as stated in the project proposal is to document the work
during each stage of the process, like implementing a new feature. Later,
the decision was made to not strictly follow that plan, as there were few
components that changed drastically. For example, in the beginning, using
chef was planned for configuration automation and management instead
of puppet. After evaluating and experimenting with it for 5 days, it was
apparent that the set-up overhead was slowing down the actual development
process.
<!--l. 908--><p class="indent" >   Because of that experience, the dissertation write-up process was changed to
documenting features only when they are established. And reasonably stable. The
document paper is written using the latex language.
