# Develop a web platform/infrastucture for remote/digital deployment of servers
1. Allow system administrators to easily deploy variety of linux machines through a click/select interfaces ( free distriutions )
 - arch, fedora, ubuntu, centos
2. Allow system administrators to customize the install of the systems by allowing them to choose the packages they want ( apache, nginx, openssh server)
3. Provide stats for the deployed machines
 - uptime, cpu/gpu performance, network, temperature graphs.
 - Notify on crash/high performance via email
 - Health monitoring with reincarnation ?
 - Allow system administrators to save their OS images as templates and share them on the website

- ! Pseudo-realtime bus information

In some areas of the UK, buses are tracked by GPS and this is used to provide realtime travel information on apps and at bus stops/stations about when the bus is due. However in other areas, buses are not tracked and the therefore the travel information apps/displays at bus stops rely on the timetable for the information. This causes a problem when there is traffic disruption as most of these displays/apps cannot inform the passenger about delays and in most cases the service will be seen as “gone” once the scheduled time has passed. Looking at the vast data that is provided by the Traveline service (Service routes, GPS coordinates of bus stops etc.), it could be possible to create something that uses that data to plot the route onto a Google Map for example, and using the traffic status layer, predict if there will be a delay and if so how it will impact on the timetable, therefore providing some sort of pseudo-realtime information on the busses progress. To keep things straightforward, the project could focus on one or two bus routes and then it would be easier to implement and compare the actual times compared to the predicted times. There may be some scope for this being a mobile phone app, though it may be more feasible for this project to focus on the algorithms necessary for this to work, and deliver a proof of concept along with testing data rather than a full blown app.

- Peer and Self Assessment Tool for Software Engineering Teams

The aim of the project is to create a simple web-based tool that will allow individuals to evaluate their own performance and skill development throughout a Software Engineering Project. A secondary function of the tool would allow an individual to provide anonymous feedback and to appraise the skill development, contribution and performance of team mates during a software engineering project.

# How to steal fingerprints and break into a phone?
Dr C Dong

Many mobile phones now have fingerprint-based authentication systems. They are easy to use but how secure are they? Now let's assume this: a phone uses fingerprint authentication. Now it is laying on the desk and no one is around. How easy or difficult is it to find the owner's fingerprints, and duplicate them, and break into the phone? An initial idea: every time you scan your fingerprint, you actually leave the fingerprint on the sensor. Can you copy it and make a faked finger tip to pass the authentication? In this project, you can investigate along this line and/or experiment with other evil ideas you have.

# Online Musician Finder
- Dr PD Ezhilchelvan

This project aims at creating an online musician finder for budding musicians seeking bands, as well as a place in which bands seeking members can scout for talent. It shall include features such as: - musician profiling, personal space in which an individual or group can sell themselves to others - uploading/downloading of music examples - various methods to communicate with other members Note: The project can be suitably tailored to IS students without involving too much of programming. - Discussion forums - Notification of interest in a member via text message - A private area for existing bands - To create/display practice schedules - Email schedules to all band members Technology being considered for achieving the project aim will be: - Use of web 2.0 concepts such as Ajax to enhance usability - Use of a server side scripting language, such as PHP, together with SQL, in order to develop a dynamic database driven system - Use of java to enable the system to work in a number of environments

# Scientific Publishing with Interactive Graphs
- Dr P Lord

Currently, most scientific papers are published on the web largely by allowing downloads of PDFs. In this project, we will exploit current web technologies, so that the readers can see data presented as graphs, which are interactive, when the user can scale, select and reorganize the data that they can see. Additionally the underlying data will be accessible to either reader or machine-interpretable.

- Mobile guidebook for a scenic bus route

The aim of this project is to produce a mobile app to act as a guide for passengers on at least one scenic bus route in the North West of England. A basic app should highlight forthcoming points of interest along the route. A more advanced app could use location detection in order to bring up relevant places of interest that might be seen from the bus as the user gets nearer. A further advancement would be to overcome the issue of poor mobile coverage in rural England by either pulling up a variety of places before a known signal blackspot or to detect when the signal is fading. We have data available to indicate where the major blackspots in mobile signal are along the route.
