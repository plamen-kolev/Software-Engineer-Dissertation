## Virtualbox networking

Considerations:
Create and assign a NAT(network address translation) to each virtual machine where host 127.0.0.1:22 to 10.0.0x:22 is port-forwarded for management purposes.

Useful commands:

`vboxmanage list natnets` : lists all NAT networks and shows port forward rules

`vboxmanage list dhcpservers`

Initially the NAT did not provide outside access to the testing virtual machine

Simpler setting is to use a bridged adapter for the guest, install virtualbox-guest-dkms virtualbox-guest-utils allows the host to query the instance.
For example, if the machine's name is `server_1`, running  `vboxmanage guestproperty enumerate server_1` from the host yields very useful information.

[[app-listing]]
[source,shell]

----
vboxmanage guestproperty enumerate server_1 | grep  V4/IP | egrep -oh  "[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}.[0-9]{1,3}"
----

The command will grab only the IP of the guest.
